**Your Task:**
Extract transaction data from the provided content and return it in a structured JSON format.

**Malaysian Banking Context:**
- Date format: DD/MM/YYYY (e.g., 15/01/2024)
- Currency: MYR (Malaysian Ringgit)
- Common banks: Maybank, CIMB Bank, Public Bank, RHB Bank, Hong Leong Bank, AmBank, Bank Islam, OCBC Bank, HSBC, Standard Chartered

**Required JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "transactions": [
    {

      "description": "Clean transaction description",
      "amount": 123.45,
      "type": "income|expense|transfer",

      "balance": 1000.00,
      "category": "Category name from available categories"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Extraction Rules:**
1. **Date:** Convert all dates to DD/MM/YYYY format
2. **Amount:** Always positive numbers, type determines income/expense
3. **Type Classification:**
   - **income** (money coming IN to your account):
     * Deposits (DEPOSIT, DEP, CASH DEPOSIT, CHQ DEPOSIT)
     * Salary credits (SALARY, GAJI, PAYMENT RECEIVED)
     * Transfers received (CREDIT TRANSFER, IBG CREDIT, INSTANT TRANSFER CR)
     * Refunds (REFUND, REVERSAL)
     * Interest earned (INTEREST, PROFIT)
   - **expense** (money going OUT of your account):
     * Withdrawals (WITHDRAWAL, WDL, ATM CASH, CASH OUT)
     * Purchases (POS, PURCHASE, PAYMENT)
     * Bill payments (BILL PAYMENT, UTILITIES, TELCO)
     * Transfer sent (DEBIT TRANSFER, IBG DEBIT, INSTANT TRANSFER DR)
     * Fees and charges (SERVICE CHARGE, ANNUAL FEE, GOVT TAX)
   - **transfer** (moving between your own accounts):
     * Inter-account transfers
     * Own account transfers
4. **Description:** Clean and standardize (remove codes, extra spaces)
5. **Balance:** Running balance if shown in statement
6. **Category:** Select the most appropriate category from the available options below

@if(isset($existingCategories) && !empty($existingCategories))
**Available Categories:**
@if(isset($existingCategories['income']) && !empty($existingCategories['income']))
Income Categories: {{ implode(', ', $existingCategories['income']) }}
@endif
@if(isset($existingCategories['expense']) && !empty($existingCategories['expense']))
Expense Categories: {{ implode(', ', $existingCategories['expense']) }}
@endif

**Category Selection Rules:**
- Choose the most specific matching category based on transaction description
- Only use categories from the provided lists
- Leave category null if no good match exists
- Match category type with transaction type (income categories for income, expense for expense)
@else
**Category:** Leave as null (no existing categories available)
@endif

**Malaysian Bank Patterns & Keywords:**
- **Maybank:** POS, ATM, IBG, GIRO, FPX, MEPS, JomPAY
- **CIMB:** CIMB Clicks, PayNow, DuitNow, Bill Payment
- **Public Bank:** PBe, Instant Transfer, Standing Instruction
- **E-wallets:** Touch 'n Go (TNG), GrabPay, Boost, ShopeePay, BigPay
- **Common Terms:**
  * CR/CREDIT = Money IN (income)
  * DR/DEBIT = Money OUT (expense)
  * DEP/DEPOSIT = Money IN (income)
  * WDL/WITHDRAWAL = Money OUT (expense)

@if(isset($userInstructions) && !empty($userInstructions))
**Additional User Instructions:**
{{ $userInstructions }}
@endif

**Important Guidelines:**
- Be accurate with amounts and dates
- Handle various bank statement formats
- Extract ALL transactions, don't miss any
- **Type Determination Logic:**
  * Look for CR/CREDIT/DEPOSIT keywords → income
  * Look for DR/DEBIT/WITHDRAWAL keywords → expense
  * Check if money increases account balance → income
  * Check if money decreases account balance → expense
  * If uncertain and no clear indicators → default to "expense"
- Only use provided categories, don't invent new ones
- Recognize that "deposit" means money coming IN (income), not going out
