# ðŸ“Š Bokku - Simple & Elegant Personal Finance Manager

## Philosophy
**Simple. Elegant. Powerful.** A personal finance manager that just works. No unnecessary complexity, just the features you need with a beautiful interface.

## Core Concept: Double-Entry Made Simple

Every transaction moves money from one place to another. That's it.
- **Income**: Money comes into your account
- **Expense**: Money goes out of your account  
- **Transfer**: Money moves between your accounts

The system automatically ensures everything balances, so you don't have to think about it.
